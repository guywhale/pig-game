A simple dice game of luck and strategy

/*
GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to his CURRENT score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 with the top dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player loses both their CURRENT and GLOBAL scores if they roll two sixes in a row on EITHER dice.
- The player can choose to HOLD, which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points in their GLOBAL score wins the game by default. However, this can be altered to a custom amount using the SET TARGET SCORE box.
